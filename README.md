3. Checkout a new branch on your local `damss` repo and commit everything you copied over from `dam/build`. Push it to the remote `damss`.

4. Go to the `damss` repo on Github and merge to master the branch you just pushed.

5. Voil√†, your changes should deploy in a few minutes to [dam-safety.github.com/damss](https://dam-safety.github.com/damss)
