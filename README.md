### Instructions for deployment on Github Pages
\* _Currently there is an org, github.com/dam-safety, and a repo, damss_

1. Do `npm run build` on the command line in the directory where you have the `dam` repo. This will run the React script to build the project.

2. Copy the contents of the `build` directory into the directory you have connected to the `damss` repo of the `dam-safety` org.

3. Checkout a new branch on your local `damss` repo and commit everything you copied over from `dam/build`. Push it to the remote `damss`.

4. Go to the `damss` repo on Github and merge to master the branch you just pushed.

5. Voil√†, your changes should now deploy in a few minutes.
